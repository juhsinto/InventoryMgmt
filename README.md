<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://todo.com)

This project was created as part of a Code assignment for an interview round. The assignment had a few requirements, which will be outlined below.

- Needs to be a full stack web application, for inventory stock management
- For the tech stack, there was a preference for a Python framework.
- Data needs to be persisted, use a Database.
- For the functionality,
  - the application should be restricted by Role Based Action Control
  - administrators should be allowed to be able to CRUD users, and inventory items (including categories)
  - managers should only be able to edit item quantity, and change the item stock status (low stock)
  - normal users should only be able to view the inventory items, and details of the items
  - Admins should be able to generate monthly inventory reports via API
  - Managers should be able to bulk update quantites using CSV uploads.
- To make things exciting, there were some additional features requested:
  - Visualize the stock trend levels over time, with a graph
  - Have notifications for low-stock alerts

### Built With

- ![React][React.js]
- ![DjangoREST][DjangoREST]

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- DESIGN CHOICES -->

## Design Choices [TODO]

- For the front-end i decided to use a normal react project, since I didn't need SSR (mostly the app consists of client side components.)
- I chose React built with Vite (CRA is now obsolete) + Typescript + Tailwind. I chose tailwind, out of familiarity. I could have also used Shadcn for UI components, to make it more accessible.
- I chose Django over FastAPI because Django seemed to have more "batteries included".
- I initially created some Proof of Concepts iterating on - user sign up (using email verification & forgot password flow). I chose not to integrate that since I was having trouble with deploying the backend.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get this project working on your local environment

### Prerequisites [TODO]

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation [TODO]

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = "ENTER YOUR API";
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap [TODO]

- [ ] Deploy to cloud
- [ ] Bulk Update Inventory via csv upload
- [ x ] Inventory Visualize Stock History

See the [open issues](https://github.com/juhsinto/InventoryMgmt/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Performance [TODO]

Scalability & Efficiency

- use oauth to manage users (instead of database) - more scalable, less things to manage
- I read a few articles (https://www.loopwerk.io/articles/2024/django-vs-flask-vs-fastapi/ and https://apidog.com/blog/fast-api-vs-django/#conclusion), which discussed the performance of FastAPI over Django. Apparently FastAPI is meant to be 6x faster in performance (handling requests per second).
